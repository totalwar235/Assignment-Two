Assignment Two

This assignment will compair the computational time of Factoring and Primality Testing

For the primality testing I wrote a function myself which has a Big O of "N", for the other primality algorithm it also has a Big O of "N". The Reason both of these are for a single for loop.

HomeBrewed :
        if ((User % 2) == 0) {
            hbprime = false;
            return duration;
        }
        for (int x = 3; x < User; x += 2) {
            temp = User % x;
            if (temp == 0) {
                hbprime = false;

                return duration;
            }
        }

Documented : 
        if (User == 2 || User == 1 || User == 0) {
            prime = true;
            return duration;
        }
        if (User % 2 == 0) {
            prime = false;
            return duration;
        }
        for (int i = 3; i <= Math.sqrt(User) + 1; i = i + 2) {
            if (User % i == 0) {
                prime = false;
                return duration;
            }
        }

These Algorithms are tested with know prime numbers and 100 random numbers and timed to show the difference in optimality. The results for one of my tests are here:
